# 🧬 HematoVision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning

**HematoVision** is a deep learning-powered web application designed to classify microscopic images of blood cells into one of four categories:

* 🔴 **Eosinophil**
* 🟢 **Lymphocyte**
* 🟡 **Monocyte**
* 🔵 **Neutrophil**

This intelligent diagnostic tool leverages **Transfer Learning** with **MobileNetV2** to deliver high-accuracy predictions in real-time, wrapped in a clean and intuitive **Flask**-based web interface.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **📤 Upload** a microscopic image of a blood cell.
2. **🔍 The model** processes the image using deep learning.
3. **📈 You get** the predicted class along with a preview of the uploaded image.

This makes HematoVision an ideal assistant for biomedical learners, educators, and early-stage researchers.
